# Difference Between Statement and PreparedStatement in Java

In Java, when working with databases through JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), developers commonly use `Statement` and `PreparedStatement` objects to execute SQL queries. While both serve the purpose of executing SQL queries, they have significant differences in terms of performance, security, and usability.

## 1. Statement

- **Definition**: `Statement` is a basic interface in JDBC used to execute simple SQL queries.
- **Usage**: It is used to execute static SQL queries which do not contain parameters.
- **Execution**: SQL queries are directly passed to the database for execution.
- **Performance**: May suffer from performance issues, especially in scenarios where the same query is executed multiple times with different parameters, as the query parsing and optimization occur each time the query is executed.
- **Security**: Prone to SQL injection attacks if user input is directly concatenated with the SQL query string.

## 2. PreparedStatement

- **Definition**: `PreparedStatement` is a subclass of `Statement` in JDBC designed to execute parameterized SQL queries.
- **Usage**: It is used to execute dynamic SQL queries which contain parameters.
- **Pre-compilation**: SQL queries are pre-compiled before execution, improving performance as the database only needs to parse and optimize the query once, regardless of how many times it's executed with different parameters.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Allows developers to use placeholders (?) for parameters, which are then bound with specific values, reducing the risk of SQL injection attacks as parameter values are treated as literals, not part of the SQL statement.
- **Performance**: Generally offers better performance compared to `Statement`, especially in scenarios involving repeated execution of parameterized queries.
- **Readability**: Enhances code readability as SQL queries are separated from parameter values, making the code more maintainable.

## Conclusion

`PreparedStatement` is preferred over `Statement` in most cases due to its improved performance, security features, and better usability, especially when dealing with dynamic SQL queries containing parameters.

While `Statement` might be suitable for simple queries where parameters are not involved, `PreparedStatement` offers a more robust solution for executing SQL queries in Java applications.
